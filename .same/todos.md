## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
- [ ] **TEST DETAILED LOGGING**: Run "🔗 Batch Links (5 trang)" to see worker logs like:
  - `📄 [WORKER 4] Ages 3-5 - Page 2/5: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/...`
  - `🌐 [SCRAPER] Starting link extraction from: ...`
  - `🔄 Attempt 1/20 - PROXY - UA: Mozilla/5.0...`
  - `⚠️ [WORKER 7] Duplicate link (normal): https://www.barnesandnoble.com/...`
  - `✅ [WORKER 7] Ages 3-5 - Page 1: Saved 22 links (total: 0)`
- [ ] Verify logs update in real-time in "Nhật ký hoạt động" panel
- [ ] Test individual "Crawl Links" for single category detailed logging

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy version 58 with super detailed logging to Netlify
- [ ] Monitor production performance with enhanced logging
- [ ] Test real Barnes & Noble crawling with new log system

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add log filtering/search in UI (by worker, category, errors only)
- [ ] Export logs functionality for debugging
- [ ] Performance metrics dashboard (links/second, success rate)
- [ ] Add pause/resume functionality for long operations
