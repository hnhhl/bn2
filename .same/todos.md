# BN Scraper Development Todos

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🔧 Build Fixes - RESOLVED!
- ✅ **Fixed Netlify build errors** that were causing `/api/categories` failures
- ✅ Updated `netlify.toml` with Node 18 and simpler build command
- ✅ Added build-time safety to API routes (graceful handling when Supabase unavailable)
- ✅ Created mock Supabase client for build mode when credentials missing/placeholder
- ✅ Updated `next.config.js` with proper server output configuration
- ✅ Added placeholder environment variables for build process
- ✅ **Pushed fixes to GitHub** - ready for Netlify deployment

### Version 58: Super Detailed Real-time Logging ⭐
- ✅ Added worker-level logging system to batch processor with pushBatchLog()
- ✅ Batch logs include worker IDs, page URLs, timing info, link counts, duplicates
- ✅ Frontend merges both crawl logs and batch logs into unified "Nhật ký hoạt động" panel
- ✅ Enhanced logging shows: Worker acquisition/release, page fetching, link extraction selectors, duplicates found
- ✅ Reset log tracking when starting new crawl/batch sessions
- ✅ Increased log buffer sizes (300 lines UI, 1000 lines server-side)
- ✅ Added structured logging for scraper with request attempts, proxy usage, response times

### Previous Tasks
- ✅ Enhanced crawl progress tracking with detailed counters
- ✅ Fixed Turbopack build issues in `next.config.js`
- ✅ 76 categories successfully crawled and stored
- ✅ 16,032 product links already crawled across categories
- ✅ Batch operations working with proxy rotation

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
- [ ] **Verify Netlify build success** - build should now complete without errors
- [ ] **Set up Supabase environment variables** on Netlify dashboard:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = your Supabase project URL
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = your Supabase anon key
- [ ] **Test detailed logging**: Run "🔗 Batch Links (5 trang)" to see worker logs
- [ ] **Monitor production performance** with enhanced logging system

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Configure Supabase database (run `supabase-schema.sql`)
- [ ] Test real Barnes & Noble crawling with new log system
- [ ] Monitor application performance and error rates

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add log filtering/search in UI (by worker, category, errors only)
- [ ] Export logs functionality for debugging
- [ ] Performance metrics dashboard (links/second, success rate)
- [ ] Add pause/resume functionality for long operations

## 📊 Current Status

## 🚀 Build Fix Details
The following issues were resolved:
- **API route build errors**: Added graceful handling when database unavailable during build
- **Missing environment variables**: Added placeholder values and build-time checks
- **Static generation issues**: Configured Next.js for proper server deployment
- **Database connection failures**: Created mock client for build mode

**Build should now succeed on Netlify! Next: Add real Supabase environment variables.**
